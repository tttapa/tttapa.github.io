"name": "Hiding symbols with default visibility in shared library"
}
<p>
    The target properties ensure that the source files comprising the given target
    are compiled with the visibility set to hidden, which means that unless a symbol
    is explicitly marked “export”, it won't be exported in the shared library.
</p>
<p>
    The linker option ensures that symbols with default visibility in any static
    libraries the target depends on are not exported in the shared library either.
    <br>
    From <code>man ld(1)</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>--exclude-libs lib,lib,...
    Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not
    be automatically exported.  The library names may be delimited by
    commas or colons.  Specifying "--exclude-libs ALL" excludes symbols
    in all archive libraries from automatic export.</code></pre>
<p>
    For explicitly exporting symbols that are part of the public API, see
    <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GenerateExportHeader.html">GenerateExportHeader</a>.
