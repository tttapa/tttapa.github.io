<h2>Memory orders for C++ atomics</h2>

<p>
    The C++ standard defines six constants to specify memory ordering:
    The main two orderings are <code>memory_order_acquire</code> and
    <code>memory_order_release</code>. The default ordering is
    <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, which implies
    <code>memory_order_acquire</code> for load operations and
    <code>memory_order_release</code> for store operations, and additionally
    creates a global, sequentially consistent order of operations on atomic
    variables.
    The combined <code>memory_order_acq_rel</code> ordering applies only to
    read-modify-write operations, and implies
    <code>memory_order_acquire</code> for the read and
    <code>memory_order_release</code> for the write.
    On some architectures, it can in theory be beneficial to use
    <code>memory_order_consume</code>, which is a weaker version of
    <code>memory_order_acquire</code>, but at the time of writing, no compiler
    implements it and the specifics are <a
        href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0735r1.html">still being discussed</a>,
    so we won't cover it here.
    Finally, <code>memory_order_relaxed</code> does not impose any ordering
    constraints, so it won't be discussed in this section about memory order.
</p>

<h3><code>memory_order_acquire</code> ▼</h3>
<p>
    No reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before this load.
</p>
<p>
    Applies to load operations.
</p>

<h3><code>memory_order_release</code> ▲</h3>
<p>
    No reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered after this store.
</p>
<p>
    Applies to store operations.
</p>

<h2>Acquire-release</h2>

<p>
    An atomic operation A that performs a release operation on an atomic object M synchronizes with an atomic
    operation B that performs an acquire operation on M and takes its value from any side effect in the release
    sequence headed by A.

<h3>Fences</h3>

<h4>Fence─fence</h4>
<p>
    A release fence A synchronizes with an acquire fence B if there exist atomic operations X and Y, both
    operating on some atomic object M, such that A is sequenced before X, X modifies M, Y is sequenced
    before B, and Y reads the value written by X or a value written by any side effect in the hypothetical release
    sequence X would head if it were a release operation.
</p>

        subgraph T1

            A -->|SEQ| X["store X(M)"]
        end
        subgraph T2
            Y["load Y(M)"]
            Y -->|SEQ| B["acq fence B"]
        end
        X -->|VALUE| Y
</div>

<h4>Fence─atomic</h4>
<p>
    A release fence A synchronizes with an atomic operation B that performs an acquire operation on an atomic
    object M if there exists an atomic operation X such that A is sequenced before X, X modifies M, and B
    reads the value written by X or a value written by any side effect in the hypothetical release sequence X
    would head if it were a release operation.
</p>
<div class="mermaid">

        subgraph T1
            A["rel fence A"]
            A -->|SEQ| X["store X(M)"]
        end
        subgraph T2
            B["acq B(M)"]
        end
        X -->|VALUE| B
</div>

<h4>Atomic─fence</h4>
<p>
    An atomic operation A that is a release operation on an atomic object M synchronizes with an acquire fence
    B if there exists some atomic operation X on M such that X is sequenced before B and reads the value
    written by A or a value written by any side effect in the release sequence headed by A.

<h3>Coherence-ordered before</h3>

<p>
    An atomic operation A on some atomic object M is coherence-ordered before another atomic operation B on M if
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A is a modification, and B reads the value stored by A, or
        <div class="mermaid">

                A -->|VALUE| B
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>A precedes B in the modification order of M, or
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph T1

                A -->|MOD| B
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>A and B are not the same atomic read-modify-write operation, and there exists an atomic modification X of M such
        that A reads the value stored by X and X precedes B in the modification order of M, or
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR

                X -->|VALUE| A
                X --->|MOD| B
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>there exists an atomic modification X of M such that A is coherence-ordered before X and X is coherence-ordered
        before B.
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR

                X -->|COB| B
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Total order of sequentially consistent operations</h3>

<p>
    There is a single total order S on all <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> operations, including fences, that
    satisfies the following constraints.
</p>
<p>
    First, if A and B are <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> operations and A strongly happens before B, then A precedes
    B in S.
</p>
<div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
        subgraph T1
            A["seq_cst A"]
        end
        subgraph T2
            B["seq_cst B"]
        end
        A -->|SHB| B
</div>
<p>
    Second, for every pair of atomic operations A and B on an object M, where A is coherence-ordered before B,
    the following four conditions are required to be satisfied by S:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>if A and B are both <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> operations, then A precedes B in S; and
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph T1
                    A["seq_cst A(M)"]
                end
                subgraph T2
                    B["seq_cst B(M)"]
                end
                A -->|COB| B
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>if A is a <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> operation and B happens before a <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code>
        fence Y, then A precedes Y in S; and
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph T1
                    A["seq_cst A(M)"]
                end
                subgraph T2
                    B["B(M)"]
                    Y["seq_cst Y"]
                end
                A -->|COB| B
                B -->|HB| Y
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>if a <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> fence X happens before A and B is a <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code>
        operation, then X precedes B in S; and
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph T1
                    X["seq_cst X"]
                    A["A(M)"]
                end
                subgraph T2
                    B["seq_cst B(M)"]
                end
                X -->|HB| A
                A -->|COB| B
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>if a <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> fence X happens before A and B happens before a
        <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> fence Y, then X precedes Y in S.
        <div class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph T1
                    X["seq_cst X"]
                    A["A(M)"]
                end
                subgraph T2
                    B["B(M)"]
                    Y["seq_cst Y"]
                end
                X -->|HB| A
                A -->|COB| B
                B -->|HB| Y
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This definition ensures that S is consistent with the modification order of any atomic object M. It also
    ensures that a <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> load A of M gets its value either from the last modification of M
    that precedes A in S or from some non-<code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> modification of M that does not happen
    before any modification of M that precedes A in S.
</p>
<div class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
        A["seq_cst load A(M)"]
        X["seq_cst store X(M)"]
        Y["store Y(M)"]
        X -->|SC| A
        Y --x|HB| X
        Y -->|MOD| A
        %% TODO: order is weird here
</div>

<p>
    <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> ensures sequential consistency only for a program that is free of data races and
    uses exclusively <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> atomic operations. Any use of weaker ordering will invalidate
    this guarantee unless extreme care is used. In many cases, <code>memory_order::seq_cst</code> atomic operations are
    reorderable with respect to other atomic operations performed by the same thread.
