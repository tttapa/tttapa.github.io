<p>
    If ➌ reads the value written by ➋, then the load-acquire ➌ synchronizes
    with the store-release ➋ on the same atomic variable. Therefore, ➋ simply
    happens before ➌. Combined with the fact that ➊ is sequenced before ➋ and
    ➌ is sequenced before ➍, we conclude that ➊ strongly happens before ➍.
</p>
<p>
    If ➌ does not read the value written by ➋, then there is no
    synchronization, but this is not an issue because in that case, the branch
    is not taken and ➍ is never executed.

    <li>
        the initialization of <code>handled</code> happens before ➏<br>
        from write-write coherence, initialization precedes ➏ in the modification

    </li>
    <li>
        ➋ synchronizes with ➐<br>
        ➋ inter-thread happens before ➐<br>
        ➋ happens before ➐<br>
        from write-write coherence, ➋ precedes ➐ in the modification

    <li>
        Similarly to the acquire-release example,<br>
        ➊ is sequenced before ➋, and ➋ synchronizes with ➐, and ➐ is sequenced before ➑<br>
        ➊ is sequenced before ➋, and ➋ simply happens before ➐, and ➐ is sequenced before ➑<br>
        ➊ strongly happens before ➑
    </li>
    <li>
        ➋ is sequenced before ➌<br>
        ➋ strongly happens before ➌<br>
        ➋ precedes ➌ in the total order of sequentially consistent operations
    </li>
    <li>
        ➏ is sequenced before ➐<br>
        ➏ strongly happens before ➐<br>
        ➏ precedes ➐ in the total order of sequentially consistent operations
    </li>
    <li>
        ➋ is sequenced before ➍<br>
        ➋ happens before ➍<br>

                ➌ does not happen before ➏<br>
                ➏ is coherence-ordered before ➌<br>
                The branch after ➌ is taken and ➍ is executed:<br>
                From write-read coherence, ➍ gets its value from either ➋ or ➐,
                because ➋ happens before ➍, and ➋ precedes ➐ in the
                modification order of <code>value_ptr</code> (and there are no

                from ➏, or from a side effect that follows ➏ in the
                modification order of <code>handled</code>. There is no such
                side effect, and ➌ does not take its value from ➏, so the
