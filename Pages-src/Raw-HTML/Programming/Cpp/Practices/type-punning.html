<h2>What is type punning?</h2>

<p>
    According to <a href="">Wikipedia</a>, <i>“type punning is any programming
        technique that subverts or circumvents the type system of a programming
        language in order to achieve an effect that would be difficult or
        impossible to achieve within the bounds of the formal language”</i>.<br>
    A classic example is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">Quake III fast inverse square root function</a>,
    where the bits of an IEEE 574 floating-point number are interpreted as a
    32-bit integer:
</p>

<p>
    Other uses include serialization and deserialization, where floating-point
    numbers or other types are converted to and from arrays of bytes to be
    transmitted over a network or stored to a file.
</p>
<p>
    In the previous example, an invalid <a href="c-style-casts.html">C-style pointer cast</a>
    was used to carry out the type punning. Another commonly used
    but equally incorrect method makes use of (or abuses) a union:
</p>

<h2>Why can't I use a union for type punning?</h2>

<p>
    You cannot use a union for type punning because you are not allowed to
    first write to one member of the union, and then read from a different one.
    <sup><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/union#Explanation">[cppreference:union]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, in the second example above, writing to <code>u.f</code> makes it the
    active member, starting its lifetime.
    <sup><a
            href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4868.pdf#page.285">[class.union.general]</a></sup>
    At most one member can be active at any given time.<br>
    Reading from the inactive member <code>u.bytes</code> is
    then not allowed, because its lifetime never began, and reading an object
    before the beginning of its lifetime invokes <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub">Undefined
        Behavior</a>.
    <sup><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4868.pdf#page.62">[basic.life]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    <small>Note: In C, the situation is different, C99 and later standards explicitly allow type punning using unions.

</p>

<h2>Why can't I use a pointer or reference cast for type punning?</h2>

<p>
    The C-style casts in the first example are equivalent to <code>reinterpret_cast</code> expressions.
    The rules for such casts are quite complicated, see e.g. <a
        href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast">cppreference: reinterpret_cast</a>.
    The casts required for type punning fall under items 5 and 6 on that web page, and these casts are only
    allowed when the type aliasing rules (sometimes called the <i>strict aliasing rule</i>) are satisfied.
    However, the whole point of type punning is that these type aliasing rules are not fulfilled.<br>
    In the first example,
    <code>float</code> and <code>long</code> are not <a
        href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast#Type_aliasing"><i>similar</i> types</a>
    <sup><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4868.pdf#page.97">[conv.qual]</a></sup>,
    so the aliasing rule is violated, and dereferencing the pointer resulting from the cast invokes
    <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub">Undefined Behavior</a>.
</p>
<p>
    One important exception to the strict aliasing rule are the character types
    <code>(unsigned) char</code> and <code>std::byte</code>: you can
    inspect the object representation of any object as an array of bytes through
    pointers to these character types.
</p>

<h2>What to use instead</h2>

<h3><code>std::bit_cast</code></h3>

<p>
    From C++20 onwards, you can use the <code>std::bit_cast</code> function from
    the <code>&lt;bit&gt;</code> header. <sup><a
            href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast">[cppreference:bit_cast]</a></sup>
    It performs the type punning in a safe way, additionally checking that both
    types have the same size, and that they are <a
        href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable"><i>TriviallyCopyable</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
    The fast inverse square root example can be fixed as follows:
</p>
@codesnippet{"file": "resources/type-punning-example-finvsqrt-fixed.cpp"}

<h3><code>std::memcpy</code></h3>

<p>
    Before C++20, the only valid way to perform type punning was to use the
    <code>memcpy</code> function, copying the object representation from an
    object of one type to another object of a different type.
</p>
<p>
    It should be noted that this does not mean that an actual call to the C
    library function <code>memcpy</code> will be emitted. Compiler developers
    are aware of this use of <code>memcpy</code>, and completely optimize it out
    for type punning use cases, even with optimizations disabled
    (<code>-O0</code>).
</p>
<p>
    Another valid version of the inverse square root code could be:
</p>
@codesnippet{"file": "resources/type-punning-example-finvsqrt-fixed-memcpy.cpp"}
<p>
    The <code>memcpy</code> function can also be used to fix the second example
    of converting a float to the bytes it consists of:
</p>
@codesnippet{"file": "resources/type-punning-example-union-fixed-memcpy.cpp"}

<h3>Cast to a character array</h3>

<p>
    In many cases related to serialization, using <code>memcpy</code> or
    <code>bit_cast</code> is unnecessary, thanks to the exception to the
    type aliasing rules for character types.
</p>
<p>
    For example, to write the bytes representing a <code>float</code> to a file,
    one could use a cast to a pointer to a character type:
</p>
@codesnippet{"file": "resources/type-punning-example-union-fixed.cpp"}
<p>
    Keep in mind though that this is an exception to the rule. It would not be
    valid to do the same in reverse, for example:
</p>
@codesnippet{"file": "resources/type-punning-example-union-fixed-bad.cpp"}
