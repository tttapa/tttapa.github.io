<h2>Goals and non-goals</h2>

<p>
    The goal of this guide is to get to an ergonomic workflow for developing
    scientific software using C++. It is not designed to be a tutorial of the
    C++ language itself, but an overview of useful tools (package managers,
    build systems, linters, static analysis, run-time sanitizers, debuggers,
    testing frameworks), recommendations on how to structure a (scientific) C++
    project, guidelines for interoperability with other popular languages, and
    so on.
