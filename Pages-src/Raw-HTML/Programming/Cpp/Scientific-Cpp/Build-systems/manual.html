<p>
    In this section, we'll manually invoke the compiler to build a very simple
    “Hello, World”-style program that consists of multiple source files.
    The goal is to illustrate how building software works under the hood, and
    motivate the use of a build system or build system generator to automate
    this tedious task.
</p>

<h2>Example project</h2>

<p>
    Consider a small project that consists of two libraries and a main program.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first library (A) defines the <code>say_hello()</code> function. It
        uses the <a href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt"><code>{fmt}</code></a>
        library to print a greeting to the console.</li>
    <li>The second library (B) uses the <code>say_hello()</code> function from
        library A to implement the <code>greet_many()</code> function that
        greets multiple people.</li>
    <li>Finally, the main program creates an array with names of people to greet,
        and calls library B’s <code>greet_many()</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The project layout could look something like this:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>├── liba</code>
<code>│   ├── a.cpp</code>
<code>│   └── a.hpp</code>
<code>├── libb</code>
<code>│   ├── b.cpp</code>
<code>│   └── b.hpp</code>
<code>└── main.cpp</code></pre>

<style>
    div.twocolumns {
        display: flex;
        column-gap: 1.6em;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    div.twocolumns>div {
        flex: 1 1 40%;
    }
</style>

<h3>Source code</h3>

<p>
    The source code listed below is not too important in and of itself, what
    matters are the dependencies between the different source files.
</p>

<div class="twocolumns">
    <div>
        @codesnippet{ "file": "resources/liba/a.hpp",
        "name": "Header A (liba/a.hpp)" }
    </div>
    <div>
        @codesnippet{ "file": "resources/liba/a.cpp",
        "name": "Implementation A (liba/a.cpp)" }
    </div>
    <div>@codesnippet{ "file": "resources/libb/b.hpp",
        "name": "Header B (libb/b.hpp)" }
    </div>
    <div>@codesnippet{ "file": "resources/libb/b.cpp",
        "name": "Implementation B (libb/b.cpp)" }
    </div>
    <div>@codesnippet{ "file": "resources/main.cpp",
        "name": "Main program (main.cpp)" }
    </div>
</div>


<h3>The compilation process</h3>

<p>
    To build the main executable, we need the following steps:
</p>
<ol class="circled">
    <li>Preprocess and compile all implementation files into object files.</li>
    <li>Link all object files and external libraries into an executable.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Using GCC, this can be done as follows:
</p>

@codesnippet{ "file": "resources/build.sh",
"name": "Build commands" }

<ol class="circled">
    <li>
        The <code>-c</code> option causes GCC to preprocess and <u><b>c</b></u>ompile the
        given file, writing the resulting object file to the <u><b>o</b></u>utput file
        specified using the <code>-o</code> flag.
        When preprocessing <code>a.cpp</code>, GCC needs to locate the header file
        <code>a.hpp</code>, so the directory containing this file is added to the
        <u><b>i</b></u>nclude path using the <code>-I</code> flag. Similarly, the
        preprocessing of <code>b.cpp</code> requires both <code>liba</code> and
        <code>libb</code> to be added to the search path, and <code>main.cpp</code>
        needs <code>libb</code>.
        We assume that the <code>{fmt}</code> library is installed in
        <code>/usr/include</code> or some other location that is already in GCC’s
        default search path. If this were not the case, we would add another
        <code>-I</code> or <code>-isystem</code> flag to inform the preprocessor of
        its location.
    </li>
    <li>
        The invocation of GCC without the <code>-c</code> option links the three
        object files together into an executable. Since <code>a.cpp</code> makes
        use of the <code>{fmt}</code> library, we need to <u><b>l</b></u>ink to this
        library as well, using the <code>-l</code> flag. Here we again assume that
        the <code>libfmt.so</code> library is in a standard location, otherwise we
        would need to use the <code>-L</code> flag to add its location to the
        <u><b>l</b></u>ibrary search path.
    </li>
</ol>

    The dependencies between the different files involved in the build process
    are visualized in @ref{"ref": "graph-compile-project"}.

<h2>Limitations of manual compilation</h2>

<p>
    Manually invoking the compiler like this (with or without a shell script)
    has some serious downsides and challenges, including:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Repetitiveness and boilerplate</b>: Building a C++ project involves many similar
        calls to the compiler. Although the number of commands to write can be somewhat reduced using wildcards or Bash
        scripting, we need a more structural solution that is easy to maintain when files are added or when the
        layout of the project changes.
    </li>
    <li><b>Propagation of compiler flags</b>: Some compiler options (such as preprocessor macros, C++ standard versions
        and include paths) need to be propagated from a library to its dependents. For example, library B uses library
        A, so the location of <code>a.hpp</code> needs to be added to the search paths when compiling
        <code>b.cpp</code>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Propagation of linker flags</b>: Even though
        <code>main.cpp</code> has no knowledge of the implementation of libraries A and B, it still needs to link to its
        direct dependency <code>b.o</code> and the transitive dependencies <code>a.o</code> and <code>libfmt.so</code>.
        The tree of transitive dependencies can become quite unwieldy, and they all need to come together for the final
        linking step.
    </li>
    <li><b>Incremental compilation</b>: Compiling a larger project in its entirety can often take several minutes.
        During development, this can become a serious impediment. We therefore only want to recompile the files that
        actually changed. Since the preprocessor pastes the contents of header files into the source files that include
        them (using simple text substitution of the <code>#include</code> directive), a change in a header file
        can cascade and require many source files to be recompiled. For example, if <code>b.hpp</code> is modified, both
        <code>b.cpp</code> and <code>main.cpp</code> have to be recompiled. For larger projects, the <i>included-by</i>
        graph can grow very complex, as demonstrated by @ref{"ref": "alpaqa-dep"}, and determining these dependencies
        manually is not an option.
    </li>
    <li><b>Portability</b>: The commands above only work for GCC. Users of your project might want to compile it using
        Visual Studio on Windows, or Xcode on macOS, or perhaps even cross-compile it for an embedded system. This would
        require maintaining multiple scripts or build descriptions, with the risk of them getting out of sync.</li>
    <li><b>Lack of integration with IDEs and other tools</b>: IDEs like Visual Studio, VS Code, CLion, Xcode, as well
        as language servers like clangd, or other tools such clang-tidy and Cppcheck won’t be able to easily interact
        with your project if it is described using custom commands or shell scripts.</li>
    <li><b>Implicit assumptions about dependencies</b>: In the example above, we assumed that the <code>{fmt}</code>
        library was installed system-wide, with the necessary files in GCC’s default search paths. However, this is not
        always possible, a user may have dependencies installed in their home folder, in a virtual environment, in a
        subdirectory of the project folder, or somewhere else entirely. Our build script should not make any assumptions
        or hard-code any paths. We need a standardized way to locate third-party libraries and other dependencies that
        works across systems.</li>
    <li><b>Ease of use</b>: By using a custom script or commands to build your project, you make it harder
        for users to get started with your software (especially when things don’t work as expected), and it also
        increases the friction for potential contributors that want to help improve your software or build system.
        There is great value in making the installation of your software as easy as
        <code>cmake -Bbuild -S. && cmake --build build -j && cmake --install build</code>, which is the standard
        procedure for a majority of (newer) C and C++ projects.
    </li>

    In the next chapter, we’ll look at build systems and build system generators that provide solutions to the
    issues listed above.
