    Shared libraries have two interesting properties: their code can be shared
    between different processes, and they can be loaded dynamically at run time.
    It is especially the latter feature that makes them useful: this allows you
    to load plugins or optional parts of your software while the program is
    already running.

    Shared libraries are the mechanism used by the Python interpreter to load
    and import extension modules.
    For example, when you type <code>import numpy</code> in Python, this
    will load a shared library <code>numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.so</code> with
    optimized C implementations of many NumPy functions.

    Another scientific library that is often linked as a shared library is the
    BLAS linear algebra library. When a program links to BLAS as a shared
    library, users can decide which implementation of the BLAS library they want
    to use. For example, they might want to use an implementation by Intel that
    is optimized for their specific system.
