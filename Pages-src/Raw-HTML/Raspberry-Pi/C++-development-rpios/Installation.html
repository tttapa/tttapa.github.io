<h3>Download</h3>
<p>
    Start by downloading a Raspberry Pi OS image from <a
        href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems</a>.
    <!-- I went with the Lite version because I'm only planning to run it in headless mode, without any displays. -->
</p>

<h3>Install the operating system</h3>
<p>
    You can install the operating system to an SD card using the following command:
</p>
<pre
    class="console"><code>unzip -p ~/Downloads/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M conv=fsync</code></pre>
<p>
    Before you run this command, make sure that you're writing to the correct device. In my case, my SD card appeared as
    <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>, but
    it might differ on your system. When in doubt, you can use the <code>lsblk</code> command to list the storage
    devices.
</p>
<p>
    For more information, see <a
        href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md</a>.
</p>

<h3>Enable SSH</h3>
<p>
    Mount the SD card and create an empty file with the name <code>ssh</code> in the <code>boot</code> partition.
</p>
<h3>Enable Ethernet over USB (RPi Zero only)</h3>
<p>
    Open the <code>config.txt</code> file in the <code>boot</code> partition, and append the following line to it:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>dtoverlay=dwc2</code></pre>
<p>
    In the file <code>cmdline.txt</code>, add the following option after the <code>rootwait</code> option (leave a
    space):
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>modules-load=dwc2,g_ether</code></pre>

<h3>Boot the Pi</h3>
<p>
    Ensure that you saved the files from the previous sections, safely remove the SD card, insert it into the Raspberry
    Pi and turn it on.
    Connect it to your network over Ethernet or WiFi.
</p>
<h3>Connect over USB (RPi Zero only)</h3>
<p>
    If you're using a Pi Zero without WiFi, you can connect it to your computer over USB and have it show up as a
    network interface.
    Use the correct USB port (the one labeled “USB”, not “PWR IN”).
</p>
<p>
    Give the Pi some time to boot, and then open the network settings on you computer. The Pi should show up as a wired
    network connection.
    In the IPv4 and IPv6 settings, select “Shared to other computers” to share you internet connection with the Pi.

<h3>Log in to the Pi over SSH</h3>
<p>
    Assuming that you have only one Raspberry Pi on the network, connect to it using
</p>
<pre class="console"><code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code></pre>
<p>
    The default password is <code>raspberry</code>, change it by running:
</p>
<pre class="console pi-raspberrypi"><code>passwd</code></pre>

<h3>Set up the hostname and SSH keys</h3>

<p>
    Change the hostname and restart the mDNS service, then log out.
    Feel free to use a more appropriate hostname for your specific setup, but remember to change it in the following
    commands.
</p>
<pre class="console pi-raspberrypi"><code>sudo hostnamectl set-hostname rpi0</code>
<code>sudo service avahi-daemon restart</code>
<code>exit</code></pre>
<p>
    You're now at your computer's shell again. Create an SSH configuration for the Pi:
</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cat >> ~/.ssh/config &lt;&lt; 'EOF'
Host RPi0
    HostName rpi0.local
    User pi
EOF</code></pre>
<p>
    Add your public key to the Pi's <code>authorized_keys</code>, so you can connect to it without entering the
    password each time:
</p>
<pre class="console"><code>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub RPi0</code></pre>
<p>
    If you don't have an SSH key pair yet, you can follow these instructions on how
    to create one:
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/7">DigitalOcean - How to Set Up SSH
        Keys</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can now try to connect to it without having to specify the hostname
    or username, and without having to enter your password:
</p>
<pre class="console"><code>ssh RPi0</code></pre>
