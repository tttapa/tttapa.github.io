<p>
    This guide explains how to set up a <b>cross-compilation development
        environment for the Raspberry Pi</b>. We'll be using the familiar APT package manager
    for <b>installing cross-compilation dependencies</b>, so you can just
    <code>apt-get install</code> any library from the Debian or Raspberry Pi OS
    repositories.
</p>
<p>
    We use a modern GCC 11 toolchain for C, C++ and Fortran. Configuration
    files for <b>easy on-target debugging</b> in Visual Studio Code are provided.
    A <i>hello world</i> CMake project is included as an example.
</p>
<p>
    Everything was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on the build machine and Raspberry
    Pi OS Buster on a Raspberry Pi Zero.
</p>

    If you're targeting a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu, also see the <a href="../C++-Development-Ubuntu/index.html">Ubuntu to
        Ubuntu Cross C++ Development</a> guide.
