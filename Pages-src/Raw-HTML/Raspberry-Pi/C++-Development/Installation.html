<h3>Operating Systems</h3>

<p>
    This guide is focussed on Linux as an operating system. While it should be possible to do most of it on Windows as
    well, I wouldn't recommend it at all. Development tools are harder to install on Windows, and building the
    Docker containers will take much longer, especially if you don't have Windows Pro or Enterprise (Windows Home
    doesn't have Hyper-V and Containers support).<br>
    I've worked in a team where some developers preferred Windows, and I (eventually) got most of it to run correctly,
    but it wasn't worth it. Compiling large projects in a virtualized Docker container was many times slower than doing
    the same thing natively on Linux, the network configuration to connect to the Raspberry Pi directly was a pain,
    on-target debugging was not supported, because the Windows tools don't support <code>gdb-server</code>, etc.<br>
    In the end, everyone moved to Linux, because it was so much faster and easier to use.<br>
    If you want to get serious about developing C/C++ software for the Raspberry Pi, installing Linux is definitely
    worth it.
</p>
<p>
    I'll be using Ubuntu 19.10 throughout this guide, but pretty much everything applies to other Linux distributions as
    well. The most significant difference will be the package manager used. On Ubuntu, I'll use APT and Snap, but most
    packages should be available in your distro's package manager as well.
</p>

<h3>Git</h3>

<p>
    The <code>RPi-Cpp-Toolchain</code> repository uses Git as a version control system. Install it so you can 
    download the repository in the next step.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
    Either download Git from the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">website</a>, or install it using your
    package manager:
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>sudo apt install git</code>
</pre>

<h3>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">RPi-Cpp-Toolchain</span> repository</h3>

<p>
    Clone the repository from GitHub. We'll clone it to <code>~/GitHub/RPi-Cpp-Toolchain</code>, but feel
    free to put it where ever you like.
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>mkdir -p ~/GitHub</code>
<code>cd ~/GitHub</code>
<code>git clone https://github.com/tttapa/RPi-Cpp-Toolchain.git</code>
</pre>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>
    I don't like to do a lot of installations on my main Linux box, so I built the toolchain and most of the libraries
    inside of a Docker container.
    This has the added benefit that all builds are reproducible, and it's easy to undo the previous step or even start
    from scratch. <br>
    You can find more information about the use of Docker on the next page.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
    You need Docker to pull or build the toolchain. Docker Compose is optional.
    <!-- TODO: explain why you need Docker Compose -->
    <br> You can find detailed installation instructions here:

    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>
    This guide uses Visual Studio Code as the main editor, and the repository contains the necessary configuration
    files, build tasks, debug configurations, etc. If you know what you're doing, you can of course use any editor
    or IDE, with your own configuration files, but if you're a beginner, I'd recommend VSCode to follow along.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
    You can either download VSCode from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>,
    or if you're on Linux, you can install it as a <a href="https://snapcraft.io/code">Snap</a>:
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>sudo snap install code --classic</code>
</pre>

<h4>Extensions</h4>

<p>
    The two most important extensions we'll use in this project, are the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools">C/C++ extension</a> and the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools">CMake Tools extension</a>.<br>
    I'd also recommend installing <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake">CMake
        language support</a> for syntax highlighting and suggestions in CMake code.
    If you plan on editing the Dockerfiles to modify the toolchain or the libraries, you might find the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker">Docker extension</a>
    useful as well.

<h3>Build tools</h3>

<h4>CMake</h4>

<p>
    CMake is a tool to configure C/C++ projects. It takes care of dependencies between parts of your project,
    external libraries, and generates build files that are later used to compile the code.
</p>
<p>
    You can download the latest version of CMake from the official <a href="https://cmake.org/">website</a>, or
    you can install it using your package manager:
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>sudo apt install cmake</code>
</pre>

<h4>Make</h4>

<p>
    After the project is configured using CMake, Make is used to build everything. It tracks dependencies and
    invokes the compiler and other tools to compile all code with the options determined by CMake.
</p>
<p>
    You can download the source code for Make from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">website</a>,
    but it's much easier to just install it using the package manager:
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>sudo apt install make</code>
</pre>
<p>
    If you've installed CMake using the package manager, Make will probably already be installed.
</p>

<h4>GCC (optional)</h4>

<p>
    GCC is a collection of compilers, including C, C++ and Fortran compilers. We'll build our own GCC
    cross-compilation toolchain later, so you don't really need to install a native version of GCC on your
    computer, but I'd recommend it nonetheless. It's very useful for testing and debugging parts of your code that don't
    <i>have</i> to be run on the Raspberry Pi.
</p>
<p>
    You can install your distro's default version of GCC using the package manager:
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>sudo apt install gcc g++</code>
</pre>
<p>
    However, the default version is often out of date, especially on LTS releases of Ubuntu. Luckily, you
    can easily install the latest version from the <code>ubuntu-toolchain-r/test</code> PPA:
</p>
<pre class="console">
<code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test</code>
<code>sudo apt-get update</code>
<code>sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9</code>
</pre>
