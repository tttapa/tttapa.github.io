This page gives a high-level overview of the architecture of the motor
controller code and how the different parts interact.

<h3>General</h3>
<p>
    The control loop of the motorized faders requires pretty tight timing, so
    running it in the main loop is not really feasible if there are other slow
    operations going on, such as updating displays or reading many potentiometers
    through multiplexers. When moving the control loop
    to an interrupt handler, this implies that the ADC has to be interrupt-driven
    as well, which is incompatible with the main code using <code>analogRead()</code>.
    These factors make it hard to integrate motorized faders with the usual
    <code>Control_Surface.loop()</code> approach.
</p>
<p>
    To circumvent these issues, and to avoid having to port the
    architecture-specific interrupt and ADC code required for the control loops to all
    platforms supported by the Control Surface, I decided to implement
    the motorized fader code for the ATmega328P only. These chips are very
    popular, and Arduino Nano or Arduino Pro Mini clones can be found for under
    $5.
</p>
<p>
    The ATmega328P motor controllers communicate with the main microcontroller over
    I²C. This allows multiple ATmega328P controllers to be used
    (with up to four faders each), using only two pins (SDA, SCL).
    The main microcontroller can write the setpoint for each fader, and can
    request the fader positions and touch status. Usually, the setpoint is
    updated based on the target sent over MIDI by the DAW, and the position and
    touch status is sent back to the DAW over MIDI. An example is included in
    <a
        href="https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader/blob/master/MIDI-Controller/MIDI-Controller.ino">MIDI-Controller.ino</a>
</p>

<h3>PWM</h3>
<p>
    Timer2 and Timer0 are used to generate up to four PWM channels at a rate of
    \(31{,}250 \Hz\). This is a convenient rate, because it is outside of the
    audible spectrum. Lower frequencies cause the motor to emit annoying noises.
</p>
<p>
    One pin of the H-bridge motor driver is connected to a normal GPIO pin, the
    other to one of the four PWM outputs of the timers.
    In order to minimize the number of required IO pins, the motor driver's
    enable pins are permanently wired to Vcc. The motor is turned off by setting
    both outputs to the same level.
</p>
<p>
    The direction of the motor is reversed by inverting the GPIO output and
    inverting the PWM output by changing bit <code>COM2B0</code> in the
    <code>TCCR2A</code> register.
</p>

<h3>ADC</h3>
<p>
    It is important that the control loop runs at a regular interval. To do this,
    ADC conversions to measure the position of the faders are started in a timer
    interrupt.
</p>
<p>
    The timer interrupts fire at a high rate, and we have to change the
    multiplexer channel before starting the next measurement (because we're
    reading the position of multiple faders), so we just set the
    “start conversion” bit in the timer interrupt service routine, without
    using the auto-triggering or free-running mode of the ADC.
</p>
<p>
    Because the interrupt frequency is high (\(31{,}250 \Hz\)), we divide this
    rate further in software, by default, the frequency is reduced by a factor
    of 30. The ADC measurements are distributed evenly over those 30 interrupts.
    This is done using a simple counter:
</p>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/isr-counter.cpp"
}
<p>
    In this example, the Timer2 frequency is divided by 30, so the sampling
    rate of each of the three ADC channels
    is \(31{,}250 \Hz / 30 \approx 1{,}042 \Hz\) or \(960 \mathrm{\mu s}\). The first ADC
    conversion (measurement) is started when <code>counter == 0</code>,
    the second when <code>counter == 10</code>, and the third when
    <code>counter == 20</code>. If the number of faders doesn't divide the
    interrupt counter divisor evenly, the result of <code>adc_start_count</code>
    is floored. For example, if <code>num_faders == 4</code>, the conversions
    are started when <code>counter == 0, 7, 14, 21</code>. This doesn't affect
    the sampling rates.
</p>
<p>
    The result of the ADC conversion is written to a variable in the ADC
    conversion ready interrupt.
</p>

<h3>Control loops</h3>
<p>
    The PID controllers are updated in the main loop. They run whenever a new
    ADC measurement is available. This means that they are indirectly controlled
    by the rate of Timer2 as well:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 2em;">
    Timer2 ISR starts ADC conversion → ADC conversion writes measurement to
    variable → main loop reads ADC measurement → PID controller runs → PWM
    duty cycle is updated
</p>

<h3>Capacitive touch sensing</h3>

<p>
    The conductive knob of the fader can be seen as a small capacitive load
    connected to the Arduino pin. When the knob is touched, the capacitance is
    higher than when it is not being touched. The capacitance is not measured
    directly, instead, a large resistor is added between \(V_\mathrm{cc}\) and
    the knob, and then the RC-time is measured, i.e. the time it takes for the
    capacitive knob to charge to a voltage of \((1 - e^{-1})\, V_\mathrm{cc}\)
    through the resistor. In practice, we're measuring the time it takes for the
    voltage to rise to the Arduino's input pin high-voltage, \(V_\mathrm{IH}\),
    which is not exactly the RC-time, but the principle is exactly the same.
</p>
<p>
    Let's say that we're using a resistor of \(500 \mathrm{k\Omega}\) and that
    the capacitance of the untouched fader knob is around \(0.1 \mathrm{nF}\).
    The RC-time of this circuit is \(50 \mathrm{\mu s}\). We could then define a
    threshold of, say, \(160 \mathrm{\mu s}\). If the measured RC-time is higher than
    the threshold, we consider the knob touched. This threshold time
    corresponds to \(5\) periods of the Timer2 interrupt. The following figure
    shows the pin voltage in function of time for two scenarios: the knob being
    released and the knob being touched. The threshold time and the threshold
    voltage of \((1 - e^{-1})\, V_\mathrm{cc}\) are shown as well.
</p>
@image{
"file": "images/touch-sense/rc.svg",
"make": {"makefile": "images/touch-sense/rc.Makefile",
"cwd": "images/touch-sense"},
"source": "images/touch-sense/rc.py"
}
<p>
    To determine whether the knob is being touched, we can just look at the
    state of the pin after the threshold time: if it's high, the RC-time is less
    than the threshold time, and the knob is not touched, if it's low, the
    RC-time is higher than the threshold time, and the knob is touched.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, we just continuously charge and discharge the pin in the
    Timer2 interrupt. We simply start charging every 30 interrupts, then we
    count the number of interrupts to the threshold time (5 in this case), and
    we read the digital state of the pins. Then we switch the pin to output mode
    to discharge it for a couple of cycles, and then we start charging again.
</p>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/touch-sense.cpp"
}
<p>
    The only reason to wait 30 interrupt cycles before charging again is to
    synchronize with the ADC and the control loops. This is just for
    convenience, because in the actual
    implementation, both touch sensing and starting ADC conversions are handled
    in the same interrupt service routine.
    To minimize the overhead, all touch pins are
    on the same GPIO port, so touch sensing can be done very efficiently using
    direct port manipulation.
</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<h4>I²C (Wire)</h4>
<p>
    The motor controller acts as an I²C slave. The master can read the fader
    positions and whether they are being touched or not, and the master can
    write the position setpoints.
</p>
<p>
    The response contains the fader positions and touch status as follows
    (represented in binary):
</p>
<pre class="lineNumbers">
0000 tttt
aaaa aaaa   00aa aaaa
bbbb bbbb   00bb bbbb
cccc cccc   00cc cccc
dddd dddd   00dd dddd</pre>
<p>
    <code>tttt</code> contains the touch status of up to four faders, the least
    significant of the four bits is the first fader.<br>
    The length of the message depends on the
    <code>Config::num_faders</code> constant.
    <code>aaaa&nbsp;aaaa&nbsp;00aa&nbsp;aaaa</code> encodes the
    position of the first fader as a 16-bit Little-Endian integer,
    <code>bbbb&nbsp;bbbb&nbsp;00bb&nbsp;bbbb</code> for the second
    fader, and so on. By default,
    these positions are 14-bit numbers (obtained by oversampling and averaging
    the 10-bit ADC readings). The number of bits of the position values is
    <code>16&nbsp;-&nbsp;Config::adc_ema_K</code>, so if the
    <code>Config::adc_ema_K</code> constant changes,
    the scale of the values changes as well.
</p>
<p>
    To set the reference position, the master sends a message in the following
    format:
</p>
<pre class="lineNumbers">
rrrr rrrr   00ff 00rr</pre>
<p>
    <code>rrrr&nbsp;rrrr&nbsp;0000&nbsp;00rr</code> is the 10-bit reference
    position, encoded as a Little-Endian integer, and <code>ff</code> is the
    index of the fader to address (0 to 3).
</p>
<h4>UART (Serial)</h4>
<p>
    Tuning parameters can be updated at runtime by sending them over the serial
    port, and it is possible to start experiments, logging the
    reference, actual position, and control signal.
    The SLIP protocol
    (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1055">RFC&nbsp;1055</a>)
    is used to handle packet framing.
</p>
<p>
    The input format is explained here:
</p>
@codesnippet{
"file": "$HOME/GitHub/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader/Motor-Controller/main.cpp",
"startline": 417,
"endline": 429
}
<p>
    The outgoing messages are just SLIP packets containing the reference, the
    measured position and the control signal as three signed 16-bit
    Little-Endian integers.
