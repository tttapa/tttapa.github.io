<p>
    This page first presents a simple PID implementation in C++, then it adds 
    output clamping and integral anti-windup. Finally, it lists the real-world 
    implementation used in the actual microcontroller code.
</p>

<h2>Simple implementation</h2>

<p>
    The following listing gives a very basic implementation of a PID controller 
    in C++. It uses the formulas derived on the previous page.

}

<h3>Output clamping and anti-windup</h3>

<p>
    We can easily modify the code from the previous section to clamp the output 
    of the controller, and to stop the integral from winding up if the output 
    is already saturated:

"file": "resources/basic-pid-2.cpp"
}

<h2>Real-world implementation</h2>

<p>
    In the actual microcontroller code for the motorized fader driver, we make 
    a few changes to the algorithm introduced above:
    <ul>
        <li>We use integer types for the input, setpoint, error and integral.</li>
        <li>For efficiency, the constants \(K_i\) and \(K_d\) are premultiplied/divided by the factor \(T_s\).</li>
        <li>The output is turned off completely after a given number of cycles of inactivity (no setpoint changes or human interaction), if the error is small enough.</li>
    </ul>
