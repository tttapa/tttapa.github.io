@description: Settings to use for some common use cases, such as outputting MIDI
              directly, tuning the controllers, changing the setpoint of the
              controllers over I²C, etc.

<h2>Configuration options</h2>
<p>
    The code is very flexible and can be used in many different ways by changing
    the configuration options in <code>main.cpp:Config</code>. The settings are
    all compile-time constants, resulting in more efficient code and allowing
    for useful error messages when some options conflict or are invalid.

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<h3>Control over I²C</h3>

<p>
    This is the default configuration that is enabled out of the box. It allows
    another Arduino to read the position and the touch status of each fader, and
    to update the setpoint of each controller. Communication happens over I²C,
    and the message format is explained
    <a href="Architecture.html#communication">here</a>.
    You can have multiple motor drivers on the same bus by giving them different
    addresses, using the <code>i2c_address</code> option.
</p>
<p>
    The included example <a
        href="https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader/blob/master/MIDI-Controller/MIDI-Controller.ino">MIDI-Controller.ino</a>
    uses this mode, and it can be used as a reference implementation for sending
    and receiving the right messages.
</p>

<h3>Control over Serial</h3>

<p>
    The <code>serial_control</code> option is also enabled by default. It allows
    you to use the included <a
        href="https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader/tree/master/Python/Tuning.py">Python/Tuning.py</a>
    script to change the tuning of the controllers on the fly, and to log and
    plot their behavior.
</p>
<p>
    See <a href="PID-Tuning.html">PID Tuning</a> and
    <a href="Architecture.html#communication">Architecture: Communication</a>
    for more details.
</p>

<h3>Quick test to verify that everything is working</h3>

<p>
    Setting <code>test_reference = true</code> will result in the fader tracking
    a test sequence, as shown in the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5vZXO6RVjA">demo video</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you also set <code>print_controller_signals = true</code>, you can open
    the serial plotter (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+L</kbd>) at the correct baud rate
    (<code>serial_baud_rate = 1000000</code> by default), and view the
    reference position, the actual fader position, and the control output, as 
    shown in the figure below.
</p>

}
<p>
    The <code>controller_to_print</code> option specifies the (zero-based) index
    of the fader to print/plot the data for.
</p>

<h3>Direct MIDI control</h3>

<p>
    Although the ATmega328P doesn't have native USB support, it does support
    MIDI over Serial. After changing the <code>WITH_MIDI</code> macro to
    <code>1</code> and setting <code>serial_control = false</code>, you can send
    MIDI Pitch Bend messages to the serial port of the motor controller to 
    change the setpoints of the controllers. Fader touch changes are reported 
    back using MIDI Note On/Off messages, and while touched, the fader positions
    are sent as MIDI Pitch Bend messages.
</p>
<p>
    In this mode, you can use the included <a
        href="https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface-Motor-Fader/tree/master/Python/SerialMIDI.py">Python/SerialMIDI.py</a>
    script to test whether the MIDI communication works correctly. Instructions
    are at the top of the script (in particular, make sure that the serial port
    and baud rate are correct).
</p>
<p>
    To use the motor controller directly with 5-pin MIDI or with custom USB MIDI
    firmware, you have to select the correct MIDI baud rate: set
    <code>midi_baud_rate = 31250</code>.
</p>
<p>
    If you plan to use a software Serial-to-MIDI bridge, you'll have to select
    an appropriate baud rate as well. For example, for Hairless MIDI, set
    <code>midi_baud_rate = 115200</code>.
</p>

<h3>Debugging direct MIDI control</h3>

<p>
    The binary MIDI messages can be annoying to debug sometimes, so in addition
    to the <code>WITH_MIDI = 1</code> option described in the previous section,
    you can also set <code>MIDI_DEBUG</code> to <code>1</code> to make the motor
    controller send the MIDI messages as readable text. If you open the serial
    monitor at the correct baud rate (<code>serial_baud_rate</code>), you'll
    see messages similar to the following when touching and moving the fader:
</p>
<pre class="code">Note On          Channel: 1	Data 1: 0x68	Data 2: 0x7f
Pitch Bend       Channel: 1	Data 1: 0x30	Data 2: 0x00 (48)
Pitch Bend       Channel: 1	Data 1: 0x40	Data 2: 0x00 (64)
Pitch Bend       Channel: 1	Data 1: 0x50	Data 2: 0x00 (80)
Pitch Bend       Channel: 1	Data 1: 0x60	Data 2: 0x00 (96)
Note Off         Channel: 1	Data 1: 0x68	Data 2: 0x7f</pre>
<p>
    You can also change the setpoint of the faders from the serial monitor.
    The format is <code>Ei ll hh</code> (hexadecimal), where <code>i</code>
    is the zero-based index of the fader (0-3), <code>ll</code> are the seven
    low bits of the 14-bit setpoint, and <code>hh</code> are the seven high bits
    of the setpoint.<br>
    For example, typing <code>E0 00 40</code> into the serial monitor and
    pressing enter causes the first fader to move to the middle position. For
    subsequent setpoint changes to the same fader, you don't have to repeat the
    first byte (<code>Ei</code>), and the spaces between the bytes are optional.
    For example, first sending <code>E00040</code> moves the first fader to the
    middle position, and then sending <code>7F7F</code> moves the same fader to
    the highest position.
</p>

<h3>Improved pin assignments for Arduino Nano</h3>

<p>
    The Arduino Nano has additional analog inputs A6 and A7. You can use these
    instead of A2 and A3 to make room for two more digital pins. To do so,
    set <code>use_A6_A7 = true</code>. You can then use pin A2 for driving the
    fourth fader by setting <code>fader_3_A2 = true</code>, thereby freeing up
    pin D13 and the built-in LED. See also
