<h3>Motorized fader</h3>
<p>
    I used an ALPS Alpine 100mm, 10kΩ motorized fader, part number
    <a
        href="https://tech.alpsalpine.com/prod/e/html/potentiometer/slidepotentiometers/rsn1m/rsa0n11m9a0k.html">RSA0N11M9A0K</a>.
    These are not cheap, I paid around €30 for it.
    The knob I used is a chromed FK13x25 by
    <a href="https://www.albs.de/index.html">albs</a>. Although I cannot seem find the exact
    part number on <a href="https://www.albs.de/schieb1.htm"> https://www.albs.de/schieb1.htm</a>,
    I think <a
        href="https://www.conrad.com/p/alps-76659-slide-potentiometer-fader-knob-l-x-w-13-mm-x-25-mm-velour-chrome-442043">this</a>
    is the part I ordered.
    It is important to use a knob with a metal finish, it needs to be conductive for the touch sensitivity to work.
</p>
<p>
    I used a 100nF capacitor to filter some of the noise on the potentiometer.

<h3>Motor driver</h3>
<p>
    I used an L293D double H-bridge. It is an absolutely terrible motor driver
    by today's standards, with bipolar output transistors and a
    voltage drop of up to 3.6V. While there are much better drivers available,
    this one is cheap, popular, easy to use, and good enough to drive the small
    motor of the fader. It includes flyback diodes on the outputs, so you don't
    have to provide those externally. 
</p>
<p>
    If you want something a bit more modern, you could look at the TB6612FNG,
    for example.
</p>

<h3>Power supply</h3>
<p>
    The motor I used is rated for 10V. I used a 10V supply rated for 1A,
    which results in about 8V across the motor (taking into account the voltage drop of the L293).
    In my experiments, the motor used around 100mA during normal tracking,
    and up to 350mA when stalling the motor on purpose. According to the 
    spec sheet, they can draw up to 800mA each at 10V, so you have to take this 
    into account when selecting a power supply.
</p>

<h3>Capacitive touch sensing</h3>
<p>
    You just need an external pull-up resistor of around 500kΩ to 1MΩ.
    The exact value isn't critical, but it should be high enough to be able to 
    measure the small capacitance of the touch sensitive knob.
