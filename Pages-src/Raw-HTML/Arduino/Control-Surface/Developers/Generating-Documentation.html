<h3>Generating the documentation using Doxygen</h3>

<p>
    As mentioned before in the style guide, the library is documented using
    Doxygen. It will parse the source code, create class diagrams, calling
    networks, overviews of classes and functions, based on the comments in the
    code. All of this results in a folder of HTML files you can open in the web
    browser.
</p>

<h4>Generating the documentation in Visual Studio Code</h4>
<p>
    Press <code>CTRL+P</code>, and type "task", space, and then
    "Generate Documentation".
</p>

<h4>Generating the documentation from the terminal</h4>
<p>
    Navigate to the <code>Control-Surface/build</code> directory, and run:
</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cmake --build . --target documentation</code></pre>

<h3>Generating the coverage information using LCOV</h3>

<p>
    It is important that as many lines, special cases, and functions are covered
    by the unit tests. <br>
    GCC has a tool called GCOV to check what lines of code are executed. LCOV is
    a front-end for GCOV that exports the results as HTML pages.
</p>

<h4>Generating the coverage information in Visual Studio Code</h4>
<p>
    Press <code>CTRL+P</code>, and type "task", space, and then
    "Generate Coverage Information".
</p>

<h4>Generating the coverage information from the terminal</h4>
<p>
    Navigate to the <code>Control-Surface/build/coverage</code> directory, and run:
</p>
<pre class="console"><code>cmake --build . --target coverage</code></pre>
