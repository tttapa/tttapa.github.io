<h3>Dividing by Powers of 2</h3>
<p>
    The factor \(\alpha\) in the difference equation of the Exponential Moving
    Average filter is a number between zero and one. There are two main ways to
    implement this multiplication by \(\alpha\): Either we use floating point
    numbers and calculate the multiplication directly, or we use integers, and
    express the multiplication as a division by \(1/\alpha \gt 1\).<br>
    Both floating point multiplication and integer division are relatively
    expensive operations, especially on embedded devices or microcontrollers.
</p>
<p>
    We can, however, choose the value for \(\alpha\) in such a way that
    \(1/\alpha = 2^k, k \in \mathbb{N}\).<br>
    This is useful, because a division by a power of two can be replaced by a
    very fast right bitshift:
    $$ \alpha \cdot x = \frac{x}{2^k} = x \gg k $$
</p>
<p>
    We can now rewrite the difference equation of the EMA with this optimization
    in mind:
    $$ \begin{split}
    y[n] &amp;= \alpha x[n] + (1 - \alpha) y[n-1] \\
    &amp;= y[n-1] + \alpha \left(x[n] - y[n-1]\right) \\
    &amp;= y[n-1] + \frac{x[n] - y[n-1]}{2^k} \\
    &amp;= y[n-1] + \left(x[n] - y[n-1]\right) \gg k
    \end{split} $$
</p>
<h4>Negative Numbers</h4>
<p>
    There's one caveat though: this doesn't work for negative numbers.
    For example, if we try to calculate the integer division \(-15 / 4\) using
    this method, we get the following answer:
    $$ \begin{split}
    -15 / 4 &amp;= -15 \cdot 2^{-2} \\
    -15 \gg 2 &amp;= 0b11110001 \gg 2 \\
    &amp;= 0b11111100 \\
    &amp;= -4
    \end{split} $$
    This is not what we expected! Integer division in programming languages such
    as C++ returns the quotient truncated towards zero, so we would expect a
    value of \(-3\). The result is close, but incorrect nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
    This means we'll have to be careful not to use this trick on any negative
    numbers. In our difference equation, both the input \(x[n]\) and the output
    \(y[n]\) will generally be positive numbers, so no problem there, but their
    difference can be negative.
    This is a problem. We'll have to come up with a different representation of
    the difference equation that doesn't require us to divide any negative
    numbers:
    $$ \begin{split}
    y[n] &amp;= y[n-1] + \alpha \left(x[n] - y[n-1]\right) \\
    y[n] &amp;= y[n-1] + \frac{x[n] - y[n-1]}{2^k} \\
    2^k y[n] &amp;= 2^k y[n-1] + x[n] - y[n-1] \\[8pt]
    &amp;\ z[n] \triangleq 2^k y[n] \Leftrightarrow y[n] = 2^{-k} z[n]\\[8pt]
    z[n] &amp;= z[n-1] + x[n] - 2^{-k} z[n-1]
    \end{split} $$
    We now have to prove that \(z[n-1]\) is greater than or equal to zero.
    We'll prove this using induction:
<div style="padding-left: 2em">
    <u>Base case</u>: \(\quad n-1 = -1\)
    <div style="padding: 0.75em">
        The value of \(z[-1]\) is the initial state of the system. We can
        just choose any value, so we'll pick a value that's greater than or
        equal to zero: \(z[-1] \ge 0\).
    </div>
    <u>Induction step</u>: \(\quad n\)
    <div style="padding: 0.75em">
        Given that \(z[n-1] \ge 0\), we can now use the difference equation
        to prove that \(z[n]\) is also greater than zero:<br>
        $$ z[n] = z[n-1] + x[n] - 2^{-k} z[n-1] $$
        We know that the input \(x[n]\) is always zero or positive. <br>
        Since \(k \gt 1 \Rightarrow 2^{-k} \lt 1\), and since \(z[n-1]\) is
        zero or positive as well, we know that \(z[n-1] \ge 2^{-k} z[n-1]
        \Rightarrow z[n-1] - 2^{-k} z[n-1] \ge 0\).<br>
        Therefore, the entire right-hand side is always positive or zero,
        because it is a sum of two numbers that are themselves greater than
        or equal to zero. \(\quad\Box\)
    </div>
</div>
</p>
<h4>Rounding</h4>
<p>
    A final improvement we can make to our division algorithm is to round the
    result to the nearest integer, instead of truncating it towards zero.<br>
    Consider the rounded result of the division \(a/b\). We can then express it
    as a flooring of the result plus one half:
    $$ \begin{split}
    \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rceil &amp;=
    \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor \\
    &amp;= \left\lfloor \frac{a + \frac{b}{2}}{b} \right\rfloor \\
    \end{split} $$
    When \(b\) is a power of two, this is equivalent to:
    $$ \begin{split}
    \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2^k} \right\rceil &amp;=
    \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2^k} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor \\
    &amp;= \left\lfloor \frac{a + \frac{2^k}{2}}{2^k} \right\rfloor \\
    &amp;= \left\lfloor \frac{a + 2^{k-1}}{2^k} \right\rfloor \\
    &amp;= \left(a + 1 \ll \left(k-1\right)\right) \gg k \\
    \end{split} $$
</p>

<h3>Implementation in C++</h3>

<p>
    We now have everything in place to write a basic implementation of the EMA in C++:
</p>

@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/EMA-basic.hpp"
}

<p>
    Note how we save \(z[n] - 2^{-k} z[n]\) as the state, instead of just
    \(z[n]\).
    Otherwise, we would have to calculate \(2^{-k} z[n]\) twice (once to
    calculate \(y[n]\), and once on the next iteration to calculate
    \(2^{-k} z[n-1]\)), and that would be unnecessary.
</p>

<h3>Signed Rounding Division</h3>

<p>
    It's possible to implement a signed division using bit shifts as well. The
    only difference is that we have to subtract 1 from the dividend if it's
    negative.
</p>
<p>
    On ARM and x86 platforms, the absolute performance difference between the
    signed and unsigned version is not too big, it requires just a few more
    instructions.
    However, on some other architectures, like the AVR architecture used by some
    Arduino microcontrollers, the division is by far the most expensive step of
    the EMA algorithm, so a slower signed division might have a significant
    impact on the overall performance. In theory, it should only take a couple
    instructions to conditionally subtract 1, based on the sign of the dividend,
    but this sometimes causes the compiler to refactor the entire division,
    resulting in a much slower algorithm.
</p>
<p>
    I provided two implementations of the signed division. Notice how on x86 and
    ARM the second one is faster, while on AVR, the first one is faster.
    The unsigned division is included for reference.
</p>
<p>
    The code was compiled using the <code>-O2</code> optimization level.

<h4>Implementation of Signed and Unsigned Division by a Multiple of Two</h4>

<p>
    Keep in mind that an <code>int</code> on AVR is only 16 bits wide, whereas
    an <code>int</code> on ARM or x86 is 32 bits wide.<br>
    If you use 32-bit integers on AVR, the result is even more atrocious.
</p>
<p>
    You can experiment with the different implementations yourself on the
    <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/cmQJ7W">Compiler Explorer</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The main takeaway from this section is that signed (rounding) division is more expensive than unsigned division.
</p>

<h4>A better alternative for signed division</h4>

<p>
    Since the EMA is a linear filter, adding a constant offset to the input results in the same output, but with the
    same offset added to it. This means that we don't have to worry about negative numbers, we can just add a constant
    offset to the negative inputs, resulting in only positive numbers. At the output of the filter, the offset is simply
    removed again.
</p>
<p>
    This approach turns out to be significantly more efficient than the signed divisions discussed above. It allows us
    to use only unsigned rounding divisions, which are very cheap, and just a single extra subtraction to handle signed
    types. (Yes, just one, it turns out that adding the offset to the input and subtracting it again from the output
    can be combined.)
</p>

<p>
    <small>
        The assumption that the EMA is a linear filter is not really valid anymore, because of the rounding and
        truncation errors introduced by the use of integers in the algorithm. Luckily, the output of the filter
        turns out to be exactly the same, it doesn't matter if you use true signed rounding division or an
        unsigned rounding division with offset.
    </small>
</p>

<h3>Improved C++ implementation</h3>

<p>
    The following snippet is an improved version of the previous implementation: it supports both signed and unsigned
    inputs, allows initialization to a specific value, and has a check to prevent overflow.
</p>

@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/EMA.hpp"
}

<p>
    When the type is signed, an offset of \(2^{B-1}\) is added, where \(B\) is the number of bits used to represent
    the state variable. This essentially shifts the value "zero" up to the middle of the range of the state.
</p>

<p>
    To check the range of the input for specific template parameters, you can use the <code>supports_range</code>
    method:
</p>

@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/EMA-check.cpp"
}

<h3>Arduino Example</h3>

On most modern Arduinos, the code above should work fine. If you want to use an
older 8-bit AVR-based Arduino, you'll find that the necessary standard library
headers are missing. In that case, you could use the stripped-down version below:

@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/EMA-Arduino.ino"
}

<h3>Additional resources</h3>

<p>
    The idea to use a constant offset to deal with negative inputs originated in
    <a href="https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/61941-Exponential-Moving-Average-How-does-it-work">this PJRC forum
        thread</a>. It also includes a discussion about how the filter works, simulations comparing integer EMA
    implementations with and without rounding, a pure C implementation, etc.
